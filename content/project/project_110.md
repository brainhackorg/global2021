  "content": "**Project title:**\r\nNon-invasive brain stimulation BIDS proposal\r\n\r\n**Leader:**\r\nGiacomo Bertazzoli (@GiacomoBert)\r\n\r\n**Collaborators:**\r\nVittorio Iacovella\r\n\r\n**Topic:**\r\nReproducible scientific methods, BIDS\r\n\r\n**Project description:**\r\nBrain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a common way to structure potentially any kind of neuroimaging data. Due to its intuitive and clear structure, it has been adopted in most neuroscientific fields as a common way to organize and share data that is compliant to the F.A.I.R. principles of open science. You don\u2019t know about BIDS? Shame on you..  \r\nMore on: https://bids.neuroimaging.io/ \r\n\r\nBIDS is continuously evolving, incorporating new fields and modality through community proposals. That is where we come in! We work in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), which is a modality not yet supported by BIDS. Current NIBS includes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES, like tDCS, tACS, tRNS) and focused-ultrasound stimulation (FUS). Our project aims to build an official BIDS proposal on NIBS, that will help the whole field to structure and share data with a common framework (NIBS field desperately needs to be more open!).\r\n\r\nMe and my collaborators already wrote a BIDS proposal draft and structured a prototype of a NIBS-BIDS dataset, that you can find here: https://gin.g-node.org/CIMeC/TMS-EEG_brain_connectivity_BIDS/src/master\r\n\r\nOur goal is to gather people who already have some hands-on experience in some NIBS technique and are interested in BIDS.BIDS is helping science a lot, let\u2019s help BIDS back! \r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository:**\r\nhttps://github.com/GiacomoBert/NIBS-BIDS\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Donostia 2021:**\r\n- Open discussion on how to BIDSify NIBS data- Look in open repository for NIBS or Neuroimaging+NIBS datasets- BIDSification of the datasets using NIBS-BIDS framework \r\n\r\n**First tasks:**\r\nIf you have a datasets concerning NIBS or NIBS+Neuroimaging, you are welcome you bring it: we can work on BIDSifing your own data\r\n\r\n**Communication channels:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Video channel:**\r\nZoom\r\n\r\n**Number of collaborators:**\r\n4\r\n\r\n**Credit to collaborators:**\r\nAll new members will be listed on a contributing page and, if they want, can also participate to the writing of the final NIBS-BIDS proposal (and be among the authors)\r\n\r\n**Type of project:**\r\nData management, BIDS\r\n\r\n**Development status:**\r\nBasic structure\r\n\r\n**Programming languages:**\r\nMatlab, Python\r\n\r\n**Necessary Programming skills level for the project:**\r\nFamiliar\r\n\r\n**Necessary git skills level for the project:**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Modality:**\r\nBehavioral, ECG, ECOG, EEG, Eye tracking, DWI, fMRI, fNIRS, MEG, MRI, PET, TMS, TDCS\r\n\r\n**Image**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15833967/142841106-aa0b413e-4d11-44eb-8613-110b04a9e685.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Software suites:**\r\nBIDS, FieldTrip, EEGLab\r\n\r\n**Email:**\r\ngiacomo.bertazzoli@unitn.it\r\n\r\n**What will participants learn:**\r\nYou will learn about BIDS structure, why it is important to structure your data in BIDS and how to do it in practice\r\n\r\n**Twitter description**\r\nWe are implementing a @BIDSstandard extension to include non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as TMS, tES, FUS.. to the existing BIDS modalities!
