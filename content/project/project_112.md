  "content": "**Project title:**\nImplement Cross Frequency Coupling Analysis in EEG as Consciousness Alteration Biomarker\n\n**Leader:**\nBar Lehmann (@barlehmann)\n\n**Collaborators:**\nN/A\n\n**Topic:**\nHypothesis testing, Cross Frequency Coupling \n\n**Project description:**\nImplement code (re-created from directions from a specied research article) for evaluating cross frequency coupling of EEG data. Cross frequency coupling has been linked to meditative states, anesthesia, psychedelics, and more. This work will use already-recorded and labeled 19-channel EEG datasets and implement cross frequency coupling analysis to evaluate its sensitivity as a marker for gradations in changes in conciousness.  This will be done in MNE python and/or Matlab. This implementation will lay the groundwork to develop this project to evaluate and perhaps later on in the year implement neurofeedback for neuro-meditation. \n\n**Data to use:**\n10 minute recordings of resting state EEG 19 channels .edf files of various states of alertness from extreme tiredness of sleep deprivation of 24 hours, to poor night rest, to fully awake from good night rest, to arousal-enhancing drug + good night rest.\n\n**Link to project repository:**\nhttps://github.com/barlehmann/EEG_State_Discrimination \n\n**Goals for Brainhack Donostia 2021:**\n(1) Implement pre-made code/functions in MNE python matlab package or Matlab in completed research study on cross frequency coupling.  (2) pilot/preliminary evaluation of the implemented metrics to gauge the sensitivity of this metric for changes in fatigue depending on arusal enhancing drugs, as well as sleep deprivation\n\n**First tasks:**\nDay 1: Choose platform uniting skills and access of contributors (MNE python, vs. Matlab)Create coordination schedule / meeting times for all participants (will depend on quantity of participants / time zones, etc.), Meet with participants to discuss tasks/roles and means Chose method of CFC evaluation to begin with (either through Find Peaks or Instantaneous Frequency method) Implement this code as per the research article specs. Continue outreach to others who might be interested to contribute to this ongoing workRead study on CFC on which this implementation is based: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julio-Rodriguez-Larios/publication/351812052_ON_THE_RHYTHMS_OF_THOUGHT_EEG_alpha-theta_cross-frequency_dynamics_during_arithmetic_performance_mind_wandering_and_meditative_states/links/60ab63a045851522bc10de58/ON-THE-RHYTHMS-OF-THOUGHT-EEG-alpha-theta-cross-frequency-dynamics-during-arithmetic-performance-mind-wandering-and-meditative-states.pdf#page=83Day 2:Continue work on the code to implement CFC, perhaps adding second method if time allows.Discuss outcomes of correlations/findings or lack thereof if/when the code is implemented on the pre-recorded files. Day 3: Tie up loose ends of implementation and the correlations find in the pre-recorded EEG filesDiscuss next steps for continuing work on project. \n\n**Communication channels:**\nBar Lehmann by phone (301)-768-0307  Located in Washington, DC (Eastern Time Zone, USA).

Gain more familiarity with the relevance of cross frequency coupling relevance to conciousness states, meditation. Better understand relationships between CFC, QEEG Brain-maps, and neurofeedback from a clinician who has implemented with help of internationally reknown experts and with great success. "
