Abstract is ready but you cannot bother to read it anymore? Imagine you could automatize the abstract->poster transformation, and then just tweak a few minor things to make it shine and impress everyone in that conference! In the abstract2poster project we will work towards developping a pipeline to translate your abstract to a ready-to-present poster. How? We are planning to use `Jekyll` but other ideas are welcome!\r\n\r\n**Data to use:**\r\nThe starting point will be abstracts that are already written. We could take abstracts that project contributors have, but also conference abstracts (e.g. OHBM) that are publicly available to test how generazible the pipeline is.\r\n\r\n**Link to project repository:**\r\nhttps://github.com/amaiacc/abstract2poster.github.io\r\n\r\n**Goals for Brainhack Donostia 2021:**\r\nThis project is currently at the very beginning, so our main goal for Brainhack Donostia 2021 is to define the steps involved in the pipeline and to sketch/test how to implement each of them.\r\n\r\n**First tasks:**\r\n* define jekyll theme\r\n* build dummy site\r\n* use includes_ to feed page based on abstract (in markdown)\r\n* document process\r\n\r\n**Communication channels:**\r\n* jitsi.eus/abstract2poster\r\n\r\n**Video channel:**\r\nJitsi\r\n\r\n**Number of collaborators:**\r\n4\r\n\r\n**Credit to collaborators:**\r\nAll contributors will get credit for their work on the README file.\r\n\r\n**Type of project:**\r\nData management, Documentation, Pipeline development, Visualization\r\n\r\n**Development status:**\r\nConcept but no content\r\n\r\n**Programming languages:**\r\nR, Shell scripting, Web, markdown, HTML, CSS and JS, Jekyll\r\n\r\n**Necessary Programming skills level for the project:**\r\nFamiliar\r\n\r\n**Necessary git skills level for the project:**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Modality:**\r\nBehavioral\r\n\r\n**Software suites:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Email:**\r\na.carrion@bcbl.eu\r\n\r\n**What will participants learn:**\r\nWe will learn how to:\r\n\r\n* do research in collaborative on open source projects. \r\n* develop a pipeline, from its conceptualization till development.\r\n* write in markdown\r\n* build a static website (well... poster) using jekyll"
